## NOTE: CORS Configuration Required
## The backend at https://kwinwsproducts.cloudjiffy.net needs to allow CORS from:
## - https://bookmystarsadmin-ui-main.netlify.app
## 
## Backend should include these headers:
## Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://bookmystarsadmin-ui-main.netlify.app
## Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
## Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
## 
## Alternatively, if you want to use Netlify proxy (uncomment below and update BaseUrl.js to use '/api'):
## [[redirects]]
##   from = "/api/*"
##   to = "https://kwinwsproducts.cloudjiffy.net/:splat"
##   status = 200
##   force = true

## Redirect all routes to index.html for Single Page Application (SPA) routing
## This ensures React Router handles all client-side routes
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
